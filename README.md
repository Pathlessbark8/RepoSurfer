# Agent Workflow to understand Github Repository 

Author: Dhruv Saxena (Cambridge)

# Getting started

```bash
https://github.com/Pathlessbark8/RepoSurfer.git
cd MCPAgents
chmod +x installer.sh
```
Then execute the installer using:
```bash
source installer.sh
```
or
```bash
bash installer.sh
```

Ensure the Folder that the AI Agents need to parse is locally available within this repository. External paths, at times, might return "Access Denied" when the agents try to recursively browse through the folder.
